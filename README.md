Gemini Health is a provider of medical database integration system. It delivers drug cost decision support services to prescribers at the point-of-care to reduce drug and administrative costs for patients, providers and payers. It would provide information including the actual patient-specific costs of drugs, as well as lower cost equivalent alternative drugs and pharmacies, based upon the patient's pharmacy benefit, formularies, and related health plan coverage details. 
The main goal of this project was remodeling the architecture of the web application from monolithic to microservices and make it to be more loosely coupled, more secured and with more scalability. 

My responsibility for this project is to use spring boot for the migration to the microservices architecture
